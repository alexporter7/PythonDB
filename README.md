# PythonDB
 Basic way to interact with a database with python
 
 # Description
 
 I needed a way to interact with MariaDB on ultraseedbox so I went ahead and wrote a quick python code. This is a super early version and while I don't plan on this becoming a fully developed and released application, I do plan to provide updates to make it easy to use and a quick way to view and confirm data when working with databases
